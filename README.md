# mandelbrot-editor

An editor for slices of the Mandelbrot fractal pane.

Planned features:
 * Creation of "project folders" that contain fractal slices, palettes and animations.
 * Saving/loading a project to/from a JSON file.
 * Reference implementation that demonstrates how you can render the fractals in your own project.

Open the editor on GitHub Pages to see what has been implemented so far:

Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the fractal. Drag the position around, holding down the left mouse button.

Tested in newer versions of Firefox, Chrome and Chrome-based Edge; (Linux and Windows).

# mandelbrot-editor

An editor for slices of the Mandelbrot fractal pane.

Planned features:
 * Creation of "project folders" that contain fractal slices, palettes and animations.
 * Saving/loading a project to/from a JSON file.
 * Reference implementation that demonstrates how you can render the fractals in your own project.

Open the project on GitHub Pages to see what has been implemented so far:
